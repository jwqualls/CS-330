How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I try approaching designing software by planning how my software will be structured in terms of classes and and methods. I will write out the larger picture in pseudocode, and then begin breaking down each problem into smaller section with detail. This project helped me with my OOP and abstraction. Each feature of my program was its own .cpp and .h file. The program would call functions from these files. This helped me make quick changes to certain sections of my code without having to search for it in the same .cpp file. Abstraction is a very good ability to be able to apply to software design. This will help me in my future work as I have experience with abstraction with a larger project than a simple tutorial.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

A new development strategy I used in developing my 3D scene is how to find code, and "rewrite" it taking bits a pieces I need to work in my program. This helped me learn how to read other peoples code better so that I can rewrite the parts I need and add my own features to the code to incorporate it into my program. Iteration was a huge factor in my development because I had to write my code iteratively. Each object in my scene needed texture, lighting, and placement into the world. This made creating each objection an iterative approach. My development evolved as I would learn new features to add each week. When I learned new pieces, other older pieces could evolve because I understand how they work better. This allowed me to go back and rewrite code from previous milestones.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science helps me in reaching my goals because I want to become a developer. Computational graphics and visualization might not come up again in my educational pathway. Even though I may be done with graphics at SNHU, a future career might involve me writing computer graphics for many sectors. Whether it be video games, movies, or virtual reality, computer graphics are used in everyday life for most of the population. There are tons of jobs using OpenGL and I might see myself in a spot one day where these skills become useful.
